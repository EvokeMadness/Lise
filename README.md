## Assembling the face

Nine faces are included with the model and are in the SVG format. Each layer is a facial feature of a single color. This can be cut by hand or more accurately on a machine like the [Cricut](https://cricut.com/en_us).

### Notes & Instruction:

- Screen background and decals cut on a Cricut Explore Air 1.
	+ Material for background used: Vinyl
		+ Color: Matte black
	+ The background decal is applied to [cardstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_stock) for added rigidity.
	+ Facial features are cut on vinyl material according to their color and applied on top of the black vinyl.
	+ The screen can be attached to the head by snapping it behind the two tabs on the left and right sides of the face.
	+ The screen can be removed and replaced with different facial features by inserting a 3 mm rod through the channel on the back side of the head.
