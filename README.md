### Assembling the face

Nine faces are included with the model and are in the SVG format. Each layer is a facial feature of a single color. This can be cut by hand or more accurately on a machine like the [Cricut](https://cricut.com/en_us). Alternatively, you can print and cut ‘lise-face.pdf’ for each facial expression.

### Assembling the face steps:

- Cut the black vinyl to the desired shape to form the background.
	- Refer to 'lise-face.pdf' for dimensions.
- Apply the background decal to the cardstock for added rigidity.
- Cut the cardstock around the black vinyl.
- Cut the facial features according to their color and apply them on top of the black vinyl.
- Attach the face to the head by snapping it behind the two tabs on the left and right sides of the face.
- The screen can be removed and replaced with different facial features by inserting a 3 mm rod through the channel on the back of the head.
- Refer to 'assembly.pdf' for a detailed exploded view.
